# Contribute Development Process #

- Always make sure that you get the latest source code.<br>
- Always write a unit test for new features that you add or for issues. A unit test makes it easy to test the compiler since you can easily just run everything and make sure that your change didn't break anything. <br>
- Update the Changelog.txt file that list the changes that you made <br>
- Create a patch using your name and the date that you did it e.g. LennieDeVilliers_20100604<br>
- Submit the patch to the Development forum mailing lists <br>
- I will merge the patch into my current release build, make sure always that all unit tests pass and commit to the trunk <br>
- If there is a problem with the patch then I will send it back to you with recommendation, suggestions or a fault report. <br><br>

The above process is the same process that a big project like MonoDevelop follow, am not a difficult person or hard... but there must always b a process to keep things nice. I'm also open if you got any suggestions to make this better etc.
